Done

 -- Correct "edited" messages in the view
 -- Corrected added new messages to the right channel
 -- Correct panics when we can't find a channel for a new "message". This happens when we receive a message for "MPIM" messages.
 -- Only display desktop notifications for appropriate messages
 -- Correct channels which have no messages
 -- Correct PgDown so it will move to end of list if the length is not an exact multiple of 10
 -- Support "user typing" status
 -- Support displaying user status
 -- Refactor a "view" interface. Currently two views:
   * Chat View
   * Channel View
    They should be capable of handling their own keypresses, requesting redraws, etc
 -- Extract a "Terminal" or "Screen" interface to allow testing of Canvas
